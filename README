= Installation

To install:

   $ phpize
   $ ./configure
   $ make
   $ sudo make install

See http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/PHP+Language+Center for information on configuration options.

= Documentation

See http://us2.php.net/manual/en/book.mongo.php

= Testing

To run the tests:

   $ phpunit tests/MongoSuite

You can get information about installing and setting up phpunit at http://www.phpunit.de/.

The tests will spit out a bunch of warnings if you do not have mongo-php-driver/php on your include path, but it will just skip the tests that require that.

The tests will also attempt to create an admin user using the shell.  If "mongo" is not on your path, you will get some output complaining about it.
